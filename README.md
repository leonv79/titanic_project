# titanic_project

#This is my first attempt on a Kaggle competition. It is the most famous one, where i make predictions using the titanic dataset. The score was around 78%, using SVM. It is a promising start, considering that there are things to improve. In the code I also use logistic regression, but i haven't got the time to submit predictions with this algorithm to check the score.
